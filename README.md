### ⚠️  Notes:
- 🔧 **Early Development:** This is a work in progress, so expect some bugs. Contributions are welcome!
- **Only support for kitty:** Only supports kitty graphics protocol (so should work with kitty and wezterm).


## 📖 Usage

To use PicVim, simply open an image file in Neovim and the image will be displayed in the buffer. You can interact with the image using the provided keybindings.


## ✨ Features

- View images in Neovim.
- Zoom in and out using keybindings.
- Rotate the image with configurable keybindings.
- Pan the image using arrow keys or specific keybindings.
- Automatically scale and adjust images for optimal viewing.
- Configure keybindings and image types to work with your liking.


## ⚙️  Installation

Use your prefferred package manager to install PicVim.


### Eg. Using lazy.nvim

If you use [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), you can install PicVim by adding the following to your configuration:


```lua
{
    "Toprun123/PicVim",
    config = function()
        require'picvim'.setup()
    end,
},
```

## 🔧 Setup and Configuration

To configure the plugin, add the following to your init.lua or any other configuration file:
You can set custom keymaps using the `keymap` option.

```lua
require'picvim'.setup({
    filetypes = {                         -- Default filetypes
        "png",                            -- For now only these are supported:
        "jpg",                            -- >   PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP
        "jpeg",
        "gif",                            -- No need to set these if you want to
        "bmp",                            -- support all of these image formats.
    }
    keymap = {                            -- Default keymaps
        move_left = { "<Left>", "h" },    -- Pan left
        move_right = { "<Right>", "l" },  -- Pan right
        move_down = { "<Down>", "j" },    -- Pan down
        move_up = { "<Up>", "k" },        -- Pan up
        zoom_in = { "=", "+" },           -- Zoom in
        zoom_out = { "-", "_" },          -- Zoom out
        rotate_clockwise = "t",           -- Rotate clockwise by 30 degrees
        rotate_counterclockwise = "T",    -- Rotate counterclockwise by 30 degrees
        reset = "o",                      -- Reset image
        rerender = "r",                   -- Rerender image
    }
})
```

## 🛠️ Autocommands

The plugin automatically activates for image files (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp) (configured in the `filetypes` option) upon opening. It sets the buffer to a "non-file" type to display the image correctly.

## ⌨️  Default Keymaps

| Options within `keymap`     | Default Value         | Description              |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| `move_left`                 | `{"<Left>", "h"}`     | Moves the image left     |
| `move_right`                | `{"<Right>", "l"}`    | Moves the image right    |
| `move_down`                 | `{"<Down>", "j"}`     | Moves the image down     |
| `move_up`                   | `{"<Up>", "k"}`       | Moves the image up       |
| `zoom_in`                   | `{"=", "+"}`          | Zooms into the image     |
| `zoom_out`                  | `{"-", "_"}`          | Zooms out of the image   |
| `rotate_clockwise`          | `"t"`                 | Rotates clockwise        |
| `rotate_counterclockwise`   | `"T"`                 | Rotates counterclockwise |
| `reset`                     | `"o"`                 | Resets the image         |
| `rerender`                  | `"r"`                 | Rerenders the image      |

## Filetypes

Defaults to:
- `{ "png", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif", "bmp" }`

- You can set custom filetypes using the `filetypes` option.
    - The value must be a table of strings that includes the file extension for the image.
    - Filetypes not in the default list will not work (They'll be ignored).

## 📦 Dependencies

- `ImageMagick` for image manipulation.
- `Neovim` 0.5.0 or higher.
- `Kitty` for displaying the image.
